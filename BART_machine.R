#       Due to random seeds, results may vary to a limited degree.
#       Users can set serialize=TRUE in the bartMachine() function to save a specific model for a new session.

# Response variable

# Note: AdjRate is highly skewed (skewness = 3.64) and was therefore log-transformed.
#       The results from the BART machine won't differ with the highly skewed data, since it is 
#       non-parametric. However for all the figures in the paper we used the log-rate for higher 
#       visual interpretability. Thus - to get the same units in the PD-Plots later - we used 
#       the log-rate here, too.

# Variable selection - Returns the most important variables for the bm_All model.
#
# Note: Since I didn't set a seed the results from the var_selection might slightly differ!
#       However the "Top-10" variables proved to be consistent even when iterating over the
#       var_selection_by_permute_cv()-function multiple times with slightly different settings for
#       the number of trees. However this empirical "test" is very time consuming even with a high
#       performance system! Therefore we did not include this step in this summary.
#
#       Furthermore we removed NUTS2 and BL_ID since only a few of these factors were important.
#       Down below you can find our subset of the important variables.

# Leave the num_trees_for_permute small, to force variables to compete for entry into the model!
